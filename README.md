# Pet shop information system project in Advanced Programming 

For this group project, we were asked to implement a program in C that will simulate the operation of an information system of an animal welfare company (which we called a pet shop thoughout the whole project so that's how it'll be remembered as).

The program has the following features:
- **Insert** details for new stray animal
- **Delete** stray animal registration in code
- **Search** for stray animal records by breed
- **Update** breed name

The program stores all animal details in a text file (.txt). The file initially contains the number of saved records and then the animal records. For simplicity reasons, it is assumed that the records are exclusively related to dogs. The information that is saved for each dog is the following:
- Stray dog ID
- Stray dog breed
- Age of stray dog (years)
- Age of stray dog (months)
- Sex of stray dog

The records are sorted by dog breed upon insertion.


This repository contains:
- Pet shop database (.txt file)
- Program code (.c file)
- Program header file (.h file)
